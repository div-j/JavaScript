## Number variables
**Integer and Decimal Numbers:** JavaScript allows you to work with both integers and decimal numbers. For example:
   ```javascript
   let integerNumber = 5;
   let decimalNumber = 3.14;
   ```
**Arithmetic Operations:** You can perform various arithmetic operations on numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   ```javascript
   let sum = 5 + 3;      // 8
   let difference = 5 - 3; // 2
   let product = 5 * 3;   // 15
   let quotient = 5 / 3;  // 1.666...
   ```

 **Special Numbers:** JavaScript has special values for representing infinity and NaN (Not a Number).
 
   ```javascript
   let x = Infinity;
   let y = NaN;
   ```

**Numeric Conversions:** You can convert strings to numbers using functions like `parseInt` and `parseFloat`.
   
   ```javascript
   let z = "42";
   let convertedNumber = parseInt(z);
   ```

**Math Object:** JavaScript provides a built-in `Math` object that contains various methods for mathematical operations.
   ```javascript
  Math.sqrt(25);  // 5
   Math.random(); // random number between 0 and 1
   ```
