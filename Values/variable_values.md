### variable values (Variables)
**variable values**: These are containers used to stores values that can be changed
Examples: string variable, number variables, arrays, and objects

**Declaration**: You declare a variable using the var, let, or const keyword, followed by the variable name:
```
var x;
```
**Initialization**: You can also initialize a variable at the time of declaration:

```
let age = 25;
const pi = 3.14;
```

**Variable Names**: Variable names in JavaScript must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be numbers. Avoid using keywords as variable names.

**Scope**: Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are visible throughout the entire function. Variables declared with let and const are block-scoped, visible only within the block (enclosed by curly braces) where they are defined.
