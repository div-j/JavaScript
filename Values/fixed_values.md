# Values and Variables

## Types of Values

### Fixed Values (Constants)

Fixed values, also known as constants, are unchanging values that remain the same throughout the program. They can be numbers, letters, or other data types.

#### Example:

```
const PI = 3.14; // A constant representing the mathematical constant Pi
const greeting = "Hello, World!"; // A constant string greeting
```
