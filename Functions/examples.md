### Real Project Examples:

1. **Form Validation in a Web Application:**
   - In a web application, you might use functions to validate user input from a form. For example, a function could check if an email address is in a valid format.

   ```javascript
   function validateEmail(email) {
     // Validation logic
   }
   ```

2. **Image Processing in a Photo Editing App:**
   - In a photo editing application, functions can be used to apply various image processing operations, such as filters or color adjustments.

   ```javascript
   function applyFilter(image, filterType) {
     // Image processing logic
   }
   ```

3. **Data Analysis in a Dashboard:**
   - Functions can be employed to analyze and manipulate data in a dashboard application. For instance, a function might calculate the average sales over a specific period.

   ```javascript
   function calculateAverageSales(data) {
     // Data analysis logic
   }
   ```
